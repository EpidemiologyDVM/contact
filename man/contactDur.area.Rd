\description{
This function uses the output from distToArea to determine when tracked individuals are in "contact" with fixed locations. Individuals are said to be in a "contact" event (h) if they are observed within a given distance (<= dist.threshold) at a given timestep(i). Sec.threshold dictates the maximum amount of time a single, potential "contact" event should exist. For example, if sec.threshold=10, only "contacts" occurring within 10secs of one another will be regarded as a single "contact" event of duration sum(h). If in this case, a time difference between contacts was 11 seconds, the function will report two separate contact events.
