Description: Process spatiotemporal data into contact and social networks, and facilitating network analysis 
    by randomizing individuals' movement paths and/or related categorical variables. To use this package, 
    users need only have a dataset containing spatial data (i.e., latitude/longitude, or planar xy coordinates), 
    individual IDs relating spatial data to specific individuals, and date/time information relating spatial 
    locations to temporal locations. The functionality of this package ranges from data "cleaning" via multiple 
    filtration functions, to spatial and temporal data interpolation, to network creation and summarization. 
    Functions within this package are not limited to describing interpersonal contacts. Package functions can 
    also identify and quantify "contacts" between individuals and fixed areas (e.g., home ranges, waterbodies, 
    buildings, etc.). As such, this package is an incredibly useful resource for facilitating epidemiological, 
    ecological, ethological and sociological research.
