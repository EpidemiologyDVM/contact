Description: Process spatiotemporal data into contact and social networks, and
    facilitate network analysis by randomizing individuals' movement paths 
    and/or related categorical variables. To use this package, users need only 
    have a dataset containing spatial data (i.e., latitude/longitude, or planar
    xy coordinates), individual IDs relating spatial data to specific 
    individuals, and date/time information relating spatial locations to 
    temporal locations. The functionality of this package ranges from data
    "cleaning" via multiple filtration functions, to spatial and temporal data
    interpolation, and network creation and summarization. Functions within 
    this package are not limited to describing interpersonal contacts. Package 
    functions can also identify and quantify "contacts" between individuals 
    and fixed areas (e.g., home ranges, waterbodies, buildings, etc.). As such,
    this package is an incredibly useful resource for facilitating 
    epidemiological, ecological, ethological and sociological research.
